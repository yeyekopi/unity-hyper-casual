# unity-hyper-casual
A take-home test I completed in around 40 hours.  
I'm using a custom Entitas ECS implementation and structured MVC code.  
I also utilize canvases, object pooling and DOTween animations.

## potential improvements
- randomization
- shadow overlapping
- wobble when no merge
- gradient on ball text
- use color pallet
- shooting charge sound
- drop overall sound
- speed up refill animation
- different merge tier audio
- at the end of long merge chain there should be an extra sound
- trail on ball
- unit tests
- generate component indices
